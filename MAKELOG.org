  or, the steps I took to produce this Frontend.

** Angular 2

   Angular 2, not 1.x, because the component model is much better than some hacked vanilla ES4 crap. You can read more about [[http://learnangular2.com/][Angular2 and Components]].

*** Started by generating a new components and models.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ng new student
$ ng generate component side-bar
$ ng generate component main
$ ng generate model mark
$ ng generate model course
#+END_SRC

*** Downloading 'Vendor Assets'
    Assests are /static/ javascript, css, and font files. A vendor is someone who isn't you. Vendor assets are statis css, js, and font files which will be used by the porject.

**** Vendor Asset Sources:
     - [[https://jquery.com/][JQuery]]: A javascript UI library.
     - [[http://getbootstrap.com/][Bootstrap]]: A css framework.
     - [[http://fontawesome.io/][Font Awesome]]: Awesome icons.
     - [[photonkit.com][Photon Kit]]: Another css framework.
